            <p class="paragraph-2">My name is Mike Slaby and I am an aspiring web developer. In August of 2017 I moved to San Diego from the Boston area, where I grew up and went to college. Upon moving to Pacific Beach, I landed a sales role within a really cool digital marketing start-up called Jumper Media. After working at Jumper for about a year and a half, I have slowly come to the realization that I am not passionate about either sales or digital marketing. I can’t wait to dive into the ever-expanding world of coding and make a much-needed career change.</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph-2">Some fun facts about me: I am a die-hard Red Sox and Patriots fan (yes, this past year has been wonderful), I enjoy long boarding and hope to pick up surfing while living here, my favorite TV show is The Office, and I’ll eat anything with cheese involved.</p>
